# Daily Coding Challenges (Python)

This repository tracks my daily Python coding practice as I work to strengthen core programming fundamentals through short, focused challenge problems. Most challenges are sourced from freeCodeCamp and similar learning platforms.

## Purpose
This repo exists to:
- Build consistency through daily hands-on coding
- Reinforce Python fundamentals and problem-solving skills
- Maintain a clear record of progress over time

## Structure
Each day is stored in its own folder using the naming convention:

- `solution-day###-<challenge-name>/`

Each folder contains:
- `solution.py` – the final working solution
- `notes.md` – a short explanation of the approach and key takeaways

## Progress
- Day 001 – Array Swap
- Day 002 - Integer Hypotenuse
- Day 003 - Hex Validator 
- Day 004 - Build a Number Pattern Generator (Python Course Lab)
- Day 005 - Flatten the Array
- Day 006 - 2026 Winter Games Day 3: Biathlon (Part 01)
- Day 006 - 2026 Winter Games Day 2: Snowboarding (Part 02)

## Approach
Solutions prioritize:
- Readability and clarity
- Correctness and basic edge case handling
- Simple, idiomatic Python where appropriate

This repository is intended as a learning log and reference point, not as a collection of highly optimized solutions.
